# KBD8X-MKII-PCB
This is the source for the PCB used in the [KBD8X MKII by KBDfans](https://kbdfans.com/collections/kbd8x-mkii/products/coming-soon-kbd8x-mkii-custom-mechanical-keyboard-kit) by [ai03](https://kb.ai03.me). There have been a number of modifications to this PCB:
- Changed the MX-only footprints to MX/Alps-compatible footprints.
- Modified the routing of traces to accomodate the new footprints.
- Changed the ATmega32U4 from the -MU variety to the -AU variety so it could be hand-soldered (due to component shortages)

This PCB should work with the same firmware files as the original PCB, as the MCU and matrix are the same.

Note that this PCB is offered as-is with NO WARRANTY. If you produce it, you may encounter problems.

Please verify the conditions of the [license](https://github.com/ai03-2725/KBD8X-MKII-PCB/blob/master/LICENSE) before using.
