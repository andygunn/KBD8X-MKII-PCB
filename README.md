# KBD8X-MKII-PCB
This is the source for the PCB used in the [KBD8X MKII by KBDfans](https://kbdfans.com/collections/kbd8x-mkii/products/coming-soon-kbd8x-mkii-custom-mechanical-keyboard-kit). There have been a number of modifications to this PCB:
- Changed the MX-only footprints to MX/Alps-compatible footprints.
- Modified the routing of traces to accomodate the new footprints.
- Changed the ATmega32U4 from the -MU variety to the -AU variety so it could be hand-soldered (due to component shortages)
